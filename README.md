Wispr Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

Wispr is an experimental cryptocurrency which aims to bring a blockchain-backed secure messaging system, along with several other state-of-the-art blockchain features, as announced in our roadmap.<br>
Forked off of [Blackcoin](https://github.com/CoinBlack/blackcoin), it's a fully Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency with a fair reward system that encourages every type of user to stake and make the network more secure and efficient.
