RPICoin is an experimental cryptocurrency which aims to provide immutable blockchain solutions, along with several other state-of-the-art blockchain features, as explained in our Whitepaper.<br>
Forked off of [PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX), it's a fully Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency with a fair reward system that encourages every type of user to stake and make the network more secure and efficient.

- Anonymized transactions using the [_Zerocoin Protocol_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerocoin_protocol).
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, based on PIVX's _SwiftX_.

### Premine
The initial coins were premined in a private PoW phase up to block 450. Each block held 125,000 coins and some blocks were PoS in order to make a total of 25,000,000 RPI. Due to mining calculations an extra 125,000 RPI was mined and later [burned](https://explorer.rpicoin.com/tx/ccabff166654a078da5cda2aa758e1f801f14e8886c8b2fcc9e2d32126755fb9).<br>
To find out how the premine was distributed, check our [ANN thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2561885).
