RPICoin is an experimental cryptocurrency which aims to bring a blockchain-backed secure messaging system, along with several other state-of-the-art blockchain features, as announced in our roadmap.<br>
Forked off of [PIVX](https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX), it's a fully Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency with a fair reward system that encourages every type of user to stake and make the network more secure and efficient.

- Anonymized transactions using the [_Zerocoin Protocol_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zerocoin_protocol).
- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, based on PIVX's _SwiftX_.
